# WiFi Controlled Light Using ESP8266, Relay, Switch & MIT App Inventor

This project allows you to control a light or electrical device wirelessly using:

- NodeMCU ESP8266  
- Relay module  
- Manual wall switch / toggle switch  
- MIT App Inventor Android app  

The appliance can be controlled in **two ways**:

1. **Physically**, using a wall switch  
2. **Wirelessly**, using an app  

This makes the project work like a real smart home setup where both manual and remote control operate together.

📱 MIT App Inventor App

The app sends requests to control the relay:

http://<ESP-IP>/gpio/1   → Turn ON  
http://<ESP-IP>/gpio/0   → Turn OFF
